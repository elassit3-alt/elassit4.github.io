    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Elisha Lassiter, a Data Science major at UNC Charlotte with a strong interest 
        in automotive technology and performance engineering. I enjoy working with data, 
        building models, and finding real-world insights—especially when it intersects with 
        the automotive world. More sections will be added here as the semester progresses!

        <h3>Intro Post — Why Data Science in Society Matters</h3>
    <p>
        <h2>Blog Post #1: Why Learning Data Science in Social Contexts Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters because data has real effects on real people,
        and understanding those effects requires more than just technical skills. When we analyze data about human behavior,
        communities, health, politics, or social outcomes, we are engaging with information that reflects lived experiences.            If we ignore the social context, we risk drawing misleading conclusions, misrepresenting groups, or applying models
        that cause harm rather than help.
    </p>
    <p>
        One reason to model social topics and people is that it allows us to observe patterns that would otherwise be hidden.
        For example, data can reveal inequalities in housing, healthcare, education, or opportunities that are not obvious
        from individual experiences alone. Data can also help us evaluate policies, track social change, and make more informed
        decisions. However, modeling people also comes with responsibilities. When we work with data about human beings, we
        have to consider privacy, consent, fairness, and the potential for misuse. It matters who collects the data, how it is
        interpreted, and who benefits from the conclusions that are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, I see several responsibilities that come with using data about people. We should protect personal
        information, avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes, and remain aware that numbers never tell the full story. We should
        also recognize biases in the data itself, or in the algorithms we create. Data science does not exist in a vacuum—it is
        shaped by human choices, and it can influence people’s lives. Learning about these issues helps prevent unintended
        consequences and encourages more ethical and equitable uses of data.
    </p>
    <p>
         Through this course, I hope to better understand how to responsibly apply data science tools to real-world
        social issues. I want to learn how data can support problem-solving without oversimplifying human experiences, and how            to communicate results clearly to different audiences. Ultimately, I believe that learning data science alongside social
        context creates more thoughtful, informed, and impactful work. This is why I am excited to continue building my skills
        throughout the semester.
